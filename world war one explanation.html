<h2>How It All Began:</h2>
The war started in 1914. France wanted more land from Germany, and the German navy grew. One day, Franz Ferdinand ( from Austria - Hungary) was assasinated in Austria - Hungary, because the driver of the machine they were driving took a wrong turn and that turn led to a assasinator, killing Franz Ferdinand. the assasinator was from Serbia, so Austria - Hungary sent a list of ultimatimes to Serbia. Serbia said no, and the war started.

<h2>About The War: 
        Germany wanted to invade France and Russia. Knowing that Russia will take time to get ready due to the massive empire they had. But Russia didn't make it to France. So the Germany empire decided to go through Belgium. </h2>
